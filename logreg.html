                Logistic Regression uses the following function:

                As stated in other pages, regression algorithms attempt to model the relationship between in independent and dependent variables. In the case of
                <strong>logistic regression</strong> we do a regression to fit a binary classification.

                I did some research where we were trying to predict <strong>Student Success</strong>. The question was <strong>"Why do some students graduate and others dont?"</strong> To
                try to answer this we looked at certain courses and investigated how big of an impact that course had in predicting whether a student would graduate. We found
                that logistic regression was a very powerful tool and with the right feautres we were able to predict graduation with approximately 70% accuracy.

                Using Logistic Regression we were able to see that an individual's SAT score was a <strong>terrible</strong> predictor of <strong>Student Success</strong>.
